[Barry Byford](https://twitter.com/uk_baz) is a bit of a Bluetooth nut and he has turned his attention to the [micro:bit](http://thepihut.com/collections/microbit) and its Bluetooth interface. In this example (in the video above) he shows us how a [micro:bit](http://thepihut.com/collections/microbit) button press can be detected by the Raspberry Pi and then used to trigger LEDs on the [Ryanteck Traffic HAT](https://ryanteck.uk/hats/1-traffichat-0635648607122.html). [Details of the code and how to do it are contained in the YouTube description here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4wTXVmsWmE).
