All you need to set up this fantastic project is a webcam, a Raspberry Pi and a network connection. You can even use the official Raspberry Pi camera if you want to, as that is fully supported by the software!

## 5\. Control all your media from one place with Plex!

![Plex Media Server](https://cdn.pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/5-Plex-Media-Server.png)

> _Setting up the Plex Media Server is one of the easiest and coolest projects that any media lover can set up on their Raspberry Pi._

A Plex Media Server acts as a media aggregate allowing anyone running the Plex client to be able to connect to your server and retrieve any media that you have made available on it. This is perfect for those who like to be able to share there media around the household and not have to have numerous copies of the same data.

## 6\. Keep yourself private on the internet with this VPN Router!

![6 - VPN Wireless Router](https://cdn.pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/6-VPN-Wireless-Router.png)

If you are worried about your privacy when browsing around on the internet one of the best ways to keep yourself anonymous is to utilize a VPN! The Raspberry Pi VPN router is a cool project that creates an easy access point for you to connect to your VPN Provider. All you need to do is simply connect to the wireless access point provided by the Raspberry Pi and you will be anonymised by your VPN automatically!

All you need to setup your Raspberry Pi as a VPN Router is an ethernet internet connection and a wireless dongle that can be setup as an access point. If you have a Raspberry Pi 3 you can just use its internal Wifi antenna!

## 7\. Setup your own free private code repository!

![7 - GIT Server](https://cdn.pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/7-GIT-Server.png)

> _If you do any programming in your spare time then you will know how useful any version control can be when developing. One of the best tools for version control is GIT!_

In this project we will show how to setup your very own GIT server on your Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is great for this as it can run 24/7 without costing you a huge amount, meaning you will be able to access you GIT repositories all the time from wherever you are without it costing you a huge amount. If you love programming then this cool Raspberry Pi project is totally worth checking out.

## 8\. Track flights in your local area!

![8 - ADSB Receiver](https://cdn.pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/8-ADSB-Reciever-.png)

This is yet another one of our coolest projects and is one of the most fascinating especially for anyone who is interested in aviation. Using just a DVB-T USB TV Tuner and an antenna we can utilize our Raspberry Pi to track and receive the positions of aircraft in your area.

Your Raspberry Pi can do this by running a piece of software that tunes your TV tuner to listen in on the frequencies that aircraft use to broadcast their position. It will record these positions and then provide them to various websites. One big advantage of submitting your data to websites is that they often give you access to a free premium subscription!

## 9\. Turn any printer wireless!

![9 - Wireless print server](https://cdn.pimylifeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/9-Wireless-print-server.png)

Most of us have a perfectly good printer lying around that just becomes painful to use because of its lack of wireless capability. With this great project we show you how we can utilize the Raspberry Pi to modernise any old printer by using the Raspberry Pi as a print server!

Basically with just a USB connection to your Printer and a wireless connection on your Raspberry Pi we can allow any device in your household to connect and talk with your printer, allowing you to utilize it without having to hook it up permanently to a more costly to run computer.

That's all we have for this roundup of cool Raspberry Pi projects! As I mentioned above if you want to be kept up to date on all the latest projects, guides and much more then be sure to drop us a follow on social. Alternatively you can sign up to the mailing list and get our mini pi crash course as a thanks.
