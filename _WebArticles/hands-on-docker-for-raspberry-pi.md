  * Install and optimize Docker from scratch
  * Run our first container
  * Play with GPIO and buzzers
  * Create an IoT doorbell with a buzzer and Python / Flask

### The video

The video makes references to my previous guide featured on RaspberryPi.org. You can find more information about flashing an SD card on _Linux_ or _Windows_ there.
