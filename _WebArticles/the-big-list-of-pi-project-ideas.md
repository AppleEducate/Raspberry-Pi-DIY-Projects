Nature camera

I haven't written mine up but I used the following

Plastic lunchbox  
Clip on camera lens   
Pi camera  
PIR sensor  
pi zero  
Solar battery pack.  
Blinkit / Piglow (so you can tell what state it's in)

Basic code to start recording and set a countdown timer when PIR sensor is activated.
