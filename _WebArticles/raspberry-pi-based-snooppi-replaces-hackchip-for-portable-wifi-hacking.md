# Raspberry Pi-Based SnoopPi Replaces HackChip for Portable WiFi Hacking

A while back, we featured [the fantastic HackChip](https://blog.hackster.io/hack-chip-an-uber-portable-hacking-powerhouse-4a92a5c84293) that El Kentaro built. That all-in-one portable WiFi-hacking wonder turned out to be very popular amongst our readers, but unfortunately the HackChip died. With supply issues plaguing Next Thing Co. for the time being, El Kentaro wasn't going to be getting [a replacement C.H.I.P.](https://www.hackster.io/chip) anytime soon.

So, he set out to build himself a new workhorse: [the SnoopPi](https://medium.com/@elkentaro/snooppi-a-raspberry-pi-based-wifi-packet-capture-workhorse-part-1-n-for-snooppi-1fa14ed67e01). Like El Kentaro's other projects, the SnoopPi is intended to be used for various WiFi hacking tasks. The base of the SnoopPi is [a Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.hackster.io/raspberry-pi), which is supporting three simultaneous Alfa WiFi adapters (for different frequency bands).

[The display is a 7" Waveshare TFT](https://www.hackster.io/displays), which can be run on 5V power, making it easy to integrate with the Raspberry Pi. Input is handled with a generic Bluetooth keyboard, and everything is housed within a rugged Pelican-style case. To make everything portable, El Kentaro used an 1000mAh OmniCharge battery/inverter. This handy little unit can output power at multiple voltages, and can be recharged from a car's cigarette lighter.

The result isn't as portable as the HackChip, but it packs a lot of power. El Kentaro intends this to be a sort of [middle-ground workhorse](https://www.hackster.io/security), which combines performance with portability. While we're certainly looking forward to the next iteration of the HackChip, the SnoopPi should do him well for now.
