This project is about helping those who are visually impaired discern the person who is next to her/him. It's inspired by the [Microsoft Googles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2mC-NUAmMk&feature=youtu.be). I recognized a problem when I helped a visually impaired individual to cross the road. I know a thing or two about technology and so I made this project to help others.
