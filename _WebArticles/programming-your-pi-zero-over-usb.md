Here's a really neat solution from the inestimable Dan "[PiGlove](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-glove/), mind where you put the capitals" Aldred. If you're not able to get to another screen or monitor, or if you're on the move, this is a very tidy way to get set up.

This is a really comprehensive guide, taking you all the way from flashing an SD card, accessing your Pi Zero via Putty, installing VNC and setting up a graphical user interface, to running Minecraft. Dan's a teacher, and this video is perfect for beginners; if you find it helpful, please let us know in the comments!
