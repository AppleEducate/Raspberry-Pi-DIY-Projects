# unicorn-phat
Playing with my Raspberry Pi Zero and the Unicorn pHat

Using lib from https://github.com/pimoroni/unicorn-hat

run with `sudo ./<script file>.py`

### Scripts

- text.py: Displays text in 4x3 chars than move from right to left. Loads text from a txt file `sms.txt`. The text can be changed live by changing the file content.
- heart.py: Displays a red heart in the center of the unicorn phat.

### Thanks

- 4x3 font inspired by http://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/325977/4x3_pixel
