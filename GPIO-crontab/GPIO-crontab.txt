#
# HOW TO USE:
#
# HAVE TO RUN THIS SCRIPT WITH SUDO PRIVILIDGES. Shutdown commands needs SUDO.
# As always, we recommend using the latest version of the software. To do that use commands
#  sudo apt-get update
#  sudo apt-get upgrade
#  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade    (Note - this will update the kernel and the OS. Use it with caution.)
#
#
#
# Recommend to save this file in /usr/local/bin. Please make sure the run bit is set. Here are the commands:
# sudo cp GPIO-crontab.py /usr/local/bin
# sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/GPIO-crontab.py
#
# Now modify the crontab to execute the command every 2 minutes (or longer).
# Use "sudo crontab -e" command to add the line below:
#    */2 * * * * python /usr/local/bin/GPIO-crontab.py
#
#  The */2 can be replaced with */1 for every 1 minute, */3 for every 3 minnutes etc.
#
# Best to reboot the Pi to make sure all changes etc have been adopted.
