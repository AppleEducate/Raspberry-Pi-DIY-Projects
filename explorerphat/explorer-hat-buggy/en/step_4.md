## Choosing a chassis

To make a buggy, you will need to create a chassis so that you can attach the wheels. This is harder than it looks! We chose to use a small chocolate box because it is made of stiff cardboard and about the right size to hold the Raspberry Pi and the USB power stick. You might have a suitable box, or you might wish to create a chassis from other materials such as Lego. You could even 3D print your chassis.
