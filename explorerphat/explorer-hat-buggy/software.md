# Software Installation

To install the software you need, run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
sudo pip3 install explorerhat
sudo pip3 install guizero
```

To control your buggy remotely from another computer, you will need to install the [VNC viewer software](https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/) on that computer.
