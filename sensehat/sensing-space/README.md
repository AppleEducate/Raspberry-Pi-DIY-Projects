# Sensing Space

![cover](cover.png)

Space is a harsh environment, with extremes of temperature and pressure, and only micro-gravity. Maintaining the environment onboard the ISS so that it remains habitable for the astronauts is an amazing technical achievement.

This resource aims to teach students about the environment aboard the ISS, and how the environment can be controlled to keep it habitable.
