### Biology

- aerobic and anaerobic respiration in living organisms, including the breakdown of organic molecules to enable all the other chemical processes necessary for life

### Physics

- heating and thermal equilibrium: temperature difference between two objects leading to energy transfer from the hotter to the cooler one, through contact (conduction) or radiation; such transfers tending to reduce the temperature difference: use of insulators
- atmospheric pressure decreases with increase of height as weight of air above decreases with height
- non-contact forces: gravity forces acting at a distance on Earth and in space, forces between magnets and forces due to static electricity.
- atoms and molecules as particles
- gravity force, weight = mass x gravitational field strength (g), on Earth g=10 N/kg, different on other planets and stars; gravity forces between Earth and Moon, and between Earth and Sun (qualitative only)
