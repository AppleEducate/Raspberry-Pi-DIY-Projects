# Lesson 1 - Building your model ISS

In this lesson you are going to learn all about the International Space Station, and what the different parts of the ISS do.

## Researching the ISS module

Your teacher will place you into groups and give you the name of one of the modules of the ISS that you will be researching and then making.

Write down the name of the module of the ISS that you will be making. Using the web, find out about the module of the ISS that you have been asked to make. You need to write down:

1. When it was launched.
1. Who made it.
1. What it does.
1. Find a picture.

To help you, first try looking at this link on Simple English Wikipedia [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station)
  
## Building the ISS module

Your teacher should have shown you an example of the Tranquillity module, which will give you a good idea of how big your module will need to be.
  
1. Use the materials provided by your teacher, to build yourself a model of the module you have been assigned. Try to decorate it so that it looks as realistic as possible.
1. Remember that all the modules will need to be joined together to make a complete model of the ISS, so try to keep the size of your module similar to the teacher's Tranquility module.
