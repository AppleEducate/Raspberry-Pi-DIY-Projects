# Lesson 5 - Always Falling

## Experiment 1

1. The Sense HAT contains an accelerometer. This can measure the force applied to the Sense HAT in three directions.

2. In the first experiment, the Sense HAT and Raspberry Pi will remain motionless and the measurements from the accelerometer recorded.

3. Once the experiment has been run, graph the CSV data as you have done in previous lessons.

4. Answer the following questions
	1. Are there any forces acting on the motionless Sense HAT?
	2. In which direction does the Sense HAT experience a force?
	3. What do you think accounts for this force?

## Experiment 2

1. In the next experiment, accelerometer data is going to be captured while the Sense HAT is dropped a short distance.

2. Graph the CSV data.

3. Answer the following questions:
	1. Does dropping the Sense HAT result in a change in the forces experienced?
	2. Do the forces experienced increase or decrease?
	3. Imagine you were in a large container that was dropped out of an aeroplane. What do you think it would feel like to be inside the container? What forces would you experience?

## Experiment 3

1. In the next experiment the Sense HAT is going to be spun in a circular motion.

2. Look at the graph of the CSV data produced. Are there any changes to the forces experienced by the Sense HAT?

3. Imagine you were in a large container in space, and the container was being spun around on the end of a steel cable. What would it feel like, with regard to the forces you'd experience?
