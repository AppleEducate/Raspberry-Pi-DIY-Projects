Here are some suggestions.

Use the raspi-config utility to reset the timezone even if already you used a different tool to set it.

sudo raspi-config

Manually set the time to be somewhat accurate. NTP sometimes won't update if the time/date is wildly wrong.

sudo date -s "01/04/2017 11:00"

Manually force time update:

sudo systemctl stop ntp.service
sudo ntpd -gqc /etc/ntpd.conf
sudo systemctl start ntp.service

Make sure you aren't blocking UDP port 123.
Best of luck!
