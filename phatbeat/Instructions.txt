From the terminal window do the following:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libusb-dev
git clone https://github.com/walac/pyusb
cd pyusb
sudo python3 setup.py install

Now copy the PRRC.py to the Pi folder at the top of the directry tree, same place you've been putting the THP.py sense hat file.
Then from the terminal window run sudo crontab -e, and add the following line to the end of it.

@reboot sleep 15;sudo python3 /home/pi/PRRC.py &
ctrl x and save.

I had to put a 15 second delay so that it doesn't run until after the all the pHat Beat VLC radio stuff loads. 
You'l hear a couple of seconds of music then a second or two of garbled sound, thats my file loading.
Once the sound goes back to normal your remote should work.

The Red power button will shut the Pi down.
The buttons with the speaker + - are Volume up down.
The pause is pause, I thnk you what button that is. This is basically your mute button. I may actuall add a seperat mute function down the road.
The two button just above pause with the double triangles are the next station, prevouse station.
I matched the symbols on the remotes buttons to what is maarked on the pHat Beat.

EDIT, had to change sudo nanao crontab -e to sudo crontab -e
