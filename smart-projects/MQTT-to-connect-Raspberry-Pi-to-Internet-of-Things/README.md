# MQTT-to-connect-Raspberry-Pi-to-Internet-of-Things

# Project Discription

In this Project we are going to explain you about how you can work on MQTT using Raspberry pi. Here first of all we are going to publish HC-SR04 data to MQTT Broker and also we will tell about how to subscribe some of the topics using MQTT. For the demo purpose we've subscribed two topics named Bulb1 and Bulb2 as we are taking two leds for that. So we can control these leds from our MQTT server.

1.Raspberry pi 3

2.HC-SR04
