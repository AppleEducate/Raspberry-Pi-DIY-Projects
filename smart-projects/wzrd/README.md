wzrd.py: a circuit playground express wizard staff
==================================================

I am really just fumbling around with Adafruit's
[CircuitPython][circuitpython], a fork of [MicroPython][micropython].

This code targets the [Circuit Playground Express][playground], which I am
affixing to a staff I found in a corner of a converted garage I shared with
[Living Arts Floral][livingarts] for a few years.  (Need flowers in the Lyons,
CO area?  You can't go wrong with Jeralyn - tell her I sent you.)

I have no idea what I am doing.
